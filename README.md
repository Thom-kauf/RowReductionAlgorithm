### Interactive Row Reduction Algorithm Calculator


The infamous row reduction algorithm is an algorithm that has a dear spot in my heart. I have been wanting to do this for a while. It is finally time
that this project idea comes to fruition. 

The Interactive Row Reduction Algorithm Calculator is a .NET MAUI application, built with a combination of C# and XML.

The goal of this project is to build a useful application, but more importantly to practice event driven programming. 

# I definitely need to clean up some of the code. Some of the logic is a bit weird. It appears to be working though.
