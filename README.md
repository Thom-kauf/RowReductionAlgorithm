## Interactive Row Reduction Algorithm Calculator

The infamous row reduction algorithm is an algorithm that has a dear spot in my heart. I have been wanting to do this for a while. It is finally time
that this project idea comes to fruition. 

The Interactive Row Reduction Algorithm Calculator is a .NET MAUI application, built with a combination of C# and XML.

The goal of this project is to build a useful application, but more importantly to practice event driven programming. 

### How to use

1. Start by setting the dimensions of the matrix and click or select and press enter on the "set dimensions" button to generate a matrix of that size.
- Dimensions must be a whole number greater than 0.
2. Enter in all entries and click or press enter on reduce to obtain the answer.
- All entries must have a number.
3. In the upper left hand corner, there is a back button in case you want to modify something.
